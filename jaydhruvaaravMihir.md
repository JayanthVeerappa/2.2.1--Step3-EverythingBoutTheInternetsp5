# Email

### So Who Made It?
Most people give Ray Tomlinson the title of email’s inventor. He came up with the idea while working for ARPANET, the government-funded research project that eventually became the internet. Queen Elizabeth II was the first head-of-state to use email. V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai says a program he created as a 14-year-old is the true first version of email. Ayyadurai built his interoffice software program for the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. He called it “EMAIL.”

Up until this point, people were still calling those messages electronic mail. So, it's quite likely that Ayyadurai helped coin and popularize the term "email."
